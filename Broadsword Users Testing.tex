  \section{Introduction}
 We as the Broadsword's user team were tasked with testing team Longsword user’s code implementation of the user's module. This code will be tested on a high language level to determine whether they adhered to the functional and non-functional requirements of their module.
 
  \section{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Add user to database
\item Remove user from database
\item Logging in specified user
\item Checking if the user’s account has been activated
\item Activating a user’s account
\item Getting user’s email
\item Updating the password
\end{itemize}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}
The add user function works effectively with all the required test cases and conditions, such as checking if there exist duplicate users with the same username or password. It also provides the automated required information for the necessary fields, such as the reset key, reset date activated key. The function also provides added functionality by hashing the user’s password and persisting the hashed password to the database. There is a possibility of improvement which would be validation of the data required for each of the parameters such as checking whether the email or password is in the correct format.

\end{table}
The function that grants admin rights did as stated but left room for possible security risks as it did not check for the necessary permissions to grant a user admin rights such as checking whether the request to grant admin rights came from someone who has admin rights.
